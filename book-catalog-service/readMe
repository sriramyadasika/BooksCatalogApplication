#book-catalog-service

This API will provide the Book Catalog details for a given user.
Returns a successful response if the userId is present else will throw bad request with a message ' user does not exist'.

The project has below modules

main - This is the main class which starts our springboot application. This application is enabled on port 8083 and defined under application.properties file.

controller - The controller class will receive the incoming requests and acts as a resource class in providing the response. This API consumes two 
services books-info-service(info) and books-rating-service(rating) to get the bookId, bookName and rating given by a user. For a given userId, first we call the 
rating API which returns the list of rating object. Then we stream through the list and for each bookId in the rating object we get the corresponding booksInfo.

service - The service class talks to other APIs using Rest Template and gets the required response. Incase if any of the two APIs are down, and after subsequent request failures 
the hystrix circuit breaker opens and further calls will be routed to fallback method until service is up again.This is done using @hystrixCommand and just populated
some default values in the response.

model - This is the POJO class which holds the properties of the java objects returned in the response.

configuration - This has configuration related to swagger, to provide the API contract details in web (swagger-ui.html) and in doc.

exception - This has the global exception handler class so that the exceptions can be handled through out the application.
